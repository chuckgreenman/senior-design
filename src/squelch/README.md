# Squelch

Squelch is a Python based implementation of the SocksCatch algorithm proposed by French researchers Zaher Yamak, Julien Saunier, and Laurent Vercouter.

Sock Puppets are groups of online social accounts managed by the same person or group which can be used to start straw man arguements, steer discussion or otherwise obscure what public opinion on a topic is.  SocksCatch provides both facilities for ideentifying possible sock puppets and grouping them.
