## Project Background Description
Social media has come under scrutiny in recent years for being a place where biased information can flourish. Often, these ideas perpetrated by people with an agenda. For the average internet user, it is difficult to quickly assess whether content comes from a biased individual. We want to provide a way for people to analyze certain users they may be interacting with and determine if they are likely to publish biased information. We would achieve this by analyzing the social network surrounding a user and determining if those they interact with spread biased information or characterize a sock puppet organization.

## Project Problem Statement
Identifying biased information is resource intensive because the only way to do it well is to fact check everything. It would be useful to a user to know whether there is a reasonable risk that they are interacting with a user that curates biased information.

## Current Solution
Manual fact-checking is labor intensive and unrealistic due to the high amount of content published online. Current solutions are computationally intensive and unreliable because they try to analyze the content itself rather than the creator of the content.

## Background Skills/Interests Applicable 
As users of the internet, we all have an interest in making sure the information and users we interact with are unbiased. We are also interested in the social applications of data analysis and graph theory. We have previously taken courses in data analysis (Intelligent Data Analysis) and graph theory (Data Structures, Discrete Structures). Additionally, we have completed past projects concerning data analysis and visualization.

## Goals
We aim to build an API where if you submit a link to a user of a social media site that we support, we will return a score indicating the likelihood that the user promotes biased content. We will make this API accessible to others by creating either a web application or Chrome extension that would integrate this into a typical internet experience. This web application would also provide a visualization of the social network surrounding the user.
