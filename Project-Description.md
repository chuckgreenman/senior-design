## Project Background Description
The exploitation of social media networks came to light following the 2016 US Presidential election. Since then, the websites we use every day have become more aware of the issue, but it has also become more pervasive. With another election cycle just around the corner, we must arm ourselves with the correct tools and information to ensure we do not fall prey to false stories, targeted beliefs, and general discord. With than in mind, the Open Social Clustering and Analysis for Reddit tool, or OSCAR, hopes to provide a more informed experience on Reddit regarding its users and communities.

## Project Problem Statement
Identifying biased information or bad actors is resource intensive because the only way to do it well is to fact check everything. It would be useful to a user to know whether there is a reasonable risk that they are interacting with a user that is untrustworthy.

## Current Solution
Manual fact-checking is labor intensive and unrealistic due to the high amount of content published online. Manually scrolling through a user's profile and looking at their posting activity to determine if they seem suspicious is annoying and time inefficient. Current solutions are computationally intensive and unreliable because they try to analyze the content itself rather than the creator of the content.

## Background Skills/Interests Applicable 
As users of the internet, we all have an interest in making sure the information and users we interact with are unbiased. We are also interested in the social applications of data analysis and graph theory. We have previously taken courses in data analysis (Intelligent Data Analysis) and graph theory (Data Structures, Discrete Structures). Additionally, we have completed past projects concerning data analysis and visualization.

## Goals
* Explore users, communities, and topics on Reddit to discover flags of potentially harmful users.
* Present information and recommendations to users to make them more informed about the users and content they are interacting with online.
* Implement data analysis algorithms and visualizations to summarize available information about a user in an easily digestible way.
* Implement graph analysis algorithms and visualizations to summarize available information about user networks in an easily digestible way.

We aim to build an API where if you submit a link to a user of a social media site that we support, we will return a recommendation indicating the likelihood that the user is suspicious. We will make this API accessible to others by creating either a web application or Chrome extension that would integrate this into a typical internet experience. This web application would also provide a visualization of the social network surrounding the user.
