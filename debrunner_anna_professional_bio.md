## Project Sought
Throughout my work experience, I have really enjoyed working with algorithms and data analysis. I would like to do a senior design project that incorporates these areas since these are the fields I want to work in full-time. I would also like to get more experience with some languages or tools I haven't worked with as in depth, like Python or Java.
