## Project Abstract
The exploitation of social media networks came to light following the 2016 US Presidential election. Since then, the websites we use every day have become more aware of the issue, but it has also become more pervasive. With another election cycle just around the corner, we must arm ourselves with the correct tools and information to ensure we do not fall prey to false stories, targeted beliefs, and general discord. With than in mind, the Open Social Clustering and Analysis for Reddit tool, or OSCAR, hopes to provide a more informed experience on Reddit regarding its users and communities.
