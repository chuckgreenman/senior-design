## Project Abstract
The exploitation of social media has become an important issue in recent years, especially concerning political elections. Although awareness has increased, disinformation has become more pervasive. With another election cycle in the near future, the Open Social Comparison and Analysis for Reddit tool (OSCAR) provides a more informed experience on Reddit regarding its users and communities.
