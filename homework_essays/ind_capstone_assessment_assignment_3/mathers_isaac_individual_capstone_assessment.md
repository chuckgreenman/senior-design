# Individual Capstone Assessment


## Academic Overview

From an academic perspective, the capstone project allows us to apply what we have learned as well as dive deeper into some interesting topics. For my groupâ€™s capstone project, we will likely be dealing with three main topics: graph theory, data analysis, and scalability. First, graph theory and how we can model social networks using it will be a cornerstone of our project. Next, data analysis is crucial as our project relies on being able to draw conclusions from a set of data. Finally, I believe scalability (such as optimizing algorithms, designing processes to react quickly) will be the biggest hurdle and area to learn from in our project. There are a series of other topics that will of course have influence on our project, but I believe the aforementioned three will define our capstone.


## Useful Prior Experiences 

### School

My team will rely heavily on content taught to us through our coursework. First, as we will be examining social networks, graphs and graph theory is pertinent to our project. My team will certainly be applying what was taught to us in Data Structures (CS 2028) and Discrete Structures (CS 2071). Graphs and graph theory are topics commonly discussed in many of our classes, and it is exciting to get to apply that knowledge to our project. A big topic for our project is also data analysis. Every member of my group, myself included, have taken Intelligent Data Analysis (CS 5152) as one of our CS electives already. The techniques we learned in this course will certainly guide us through the data processing portion of our project. As we get deep into our project, I expect to learn more about these topics and much more.

### Co-op

My co-ops will also impact the execution of our project. For example, working as a Software Developer at Kinetic Vision, I gained valuable experience working with Qt, a framework design to develop user interfaces. If we move into a direction where we need a user interface, I will likely tackle that issue. Also, my time working as an Image Processing Engineer Co-op at L3Harris Technologies provided me plenty of experience with data processing. I picked up several techniques and useful technologies to assist in this endeavor that we will likely use throughout our capstone project. Additionally, working as an engineer at L3Harris Technologies, I became familiar with Agile development. While my team likely will not indulge in standup meetings and whatnot, we will be creating user stories and aiming to make iterative improvements on our product. My experience with Agile will allow me to help keep things moving and organized. 


## My Interests

Various factors go into what makes me personally interested in our capstone project. First, I use Reddit quite a lot, and it is a known fact that companies and political entities push their agenda on the platform. While there has been user pushback that attempts to call these entities out, it is still a manual process that takes quite a substantial amount of time. The product that we are aiming to produce is one that I would personally like as I scroll through Reddit. I think if I understood the user who is posting I could better understand or know to be more cautious of what they are posting. Additionally, I am interested in the project for what I can learn from it. My experience working with web applications has been limited, and this provides me an excellent opportunity to gain familiarity. Finally, I am interested to simply see what conclusions we draw about certain portions of the Reddit user base. 


## Goals and Initial Approach

The goal of our senior design project is to examine and determine trends/biased information present in social media (particularly Reddit). To do this, my team aims to identify users that post trends/biased information and then attempt to analyze the social network surrounding that user. The idea is to use graph analysis to predict if a user is prone to spread biased information based on those they have interacted with and what known biased users are posting, and if they are known to be biased, determine what kind of information they spread. I am expecting us to create an application that one can send a username or article into, and the application should provide some characteristics about the user or provide statistics on what kind of people are talking about the article. Ideally, this would be made into a web browser extension that users could use while simply browsing Reddit. Personally, I will consider our project a success if our tool is easy to use and can provide an analysis (even if it is small) at a glance to the user about other users or stories on Reddit.
