# Individual Capstone Assessment


### Academic Perspective

It has become clear over the past couple years that I have been studying computer science that our profession is based on finding asymmetric solutions to problems.  Almost everything can be accomplished through iteration, but that isn’t a good use of time or computational resources.  Binary tree are much more efficient data structures to search through than an array for example.  Our project looks at a problem with Asymmetry: it’s much easier to publish misinformation than it is to identify it.

Existing methods rely on manual fact checkers, which are expensive and need time to do research or they use some sort of NLP to identify pieces that spread misinformation that is already known.  Both of these approaches can’t get out in front of a viral piece of misinformation.


### Experiential Guidance

I took the Intelligent Data Analysis course (CS 5152) that exposed me to the idea of clustering for the first time.  Information from this course will help us build useful machine learning models.  Information Retrieval (CS 5154) covered the basics of text analysis, how the creation of bigrams and trigrams can change whether a selection of text is relevant to a query.  Additionally, both of these courses cover the idea of evaluating models and algorithms.  We’ll use those to evaluate and refine the models that we build.

During co-op I’ve had the ability to work with web applications.  This experience will help me write the API portion of our project which returns page and user scores.  Unfortunately, most of the work that I’ve done on co-op has been writing websites.  I hope to expand in to more algorithmic work with this project.  During one of my co-ops I convinced my coworkers to adopt version control on a project and agile planning techniques.


### Motivation and Preliminary Approach

We are headed into another election cycle, there will be a lot written about what transpires, some of it will be true, much of it will be opinion and some of it will be completely fake.  As we’ve seen in previous U.S. elections and elections abroad networks of people are paid to write and share propaganda.  We may be able to identify and red flag people who participate in these networks, which could render them less useful.

During the preliminary stages of this project I reached out to the NewsGuard organization.  The NewsGuard organization hires human fact checkers to review news organizations and stories.  I think the models that we build will be much stronger with their database of scored links.  Additionally, combined with access to real time social data we can help NewsGuard fact checkers get an early warning when known spreaders of misinformation start to share a new story.
