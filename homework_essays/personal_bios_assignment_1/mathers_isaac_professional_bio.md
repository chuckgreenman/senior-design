## Project Sought

My co-ops have grown my interests in algorithm optimization and development, machine learning, and image processing. As such, I am motivated to do a project with a focus on one of the aforementioned topics. Additionally, I aim to learn more about related, popular technologies used like CUDA, OpenCV, or TensorFlow.
